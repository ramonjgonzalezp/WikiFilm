# WikiFilm
WikiFilm is a Github repository that contains a Python program that uses Chrome and Selenium to open the Wikipedia webpage, search for "Universos de pel√≠culas", save the links of the top 3 results, and send them via email. This project aims to demonstrate how to use Selenium to interact with web pages and extract information from them, as well as how to send emails with Python.
