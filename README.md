# WikiFilm
WikiFilm is a Github repository that contains a Python program that uses Chrome and Selenium to open the Wikipedia webpage, search for "Universos en las pel√≠culas" and save the titles of the top 3 results. This project aims to demonstrate how to use Selenium to interact with web pages and extract information from them.
